# Blog Application

## Objectives
Develop a fully functional Blog application that meets the requirements from the three prior assignments, with additional enhancements and a polished user interface.

## Requirements

### Complete All Three Assignments
- Ensure all code and functionality from Assignments 1, 2, and 3 are fully implemented
- All associated tests must pass successfully (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
- The application must be free of bugs and handle edge cases appropriately

### User Interface (UI)
- The UI must closely resemble the example provided in class (layout, color scheme, typography, and responsiveness)
- Use modern CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap) or custom CSS to achieve a professional design
- Ensure the application is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices

### New Functionalities
Add at least three of the following new features to the Blog application:

1. **Rich Text Editor**
   - Integrate a rich text editor (e.g., Quill, TinyMCE) for creating and editing blog posts

2. **Pagination or Infinite Scroll**
   - Implement pagination or infinite scroll for blog post listings

3. **Comment System**
   - Allow users to comment on blog posts
   - Support for nested replies

## Deliverables
- [ ] Source code in a GitHub/GitLab repository (provide the link)
- [ ] All new functionality must be accompanied by E2E tests
- [ ] Your own CI pipeline executing the tests
- [ ] Deployed application URL
- [ ] A short demo video (3-5 minutes) showcasing the application's features and functionality
